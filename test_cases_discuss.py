# this is an interesting behaviour.
# zero_intermediate_nodes case behaviours as connection.
# one_or_more case the pattern node takes takes place in tree topology.
# When number id defined the  pattern first behaves as zero_intermediate_nodes
# if 0 is in the range and then as one_or_more and count the skipped.
# So in this example the {2} node is one node far from root of (C,D).
# skipping mechanism should be updated.
